<p>Hi, welcome to my profile. If you don&rsquo;t read any of this profile, don&rsquo;t expect me to return any of your messages. I don&rsquo;t like being bothered by people who can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t read a profile that I&rsquo;ve put some amount of time into. Yes, there are lewd pictures on my profile, no I am not here to have a one shot sex scene with you. I don't rp with women, children, furries, or futas. Below you will see a list of things that should be thought about if you do message me.<br /><br /><em><strong> 1. Plot always comes first. If you don&rsquo;t have any plot then don&rsquo;t message me.<br /><br /> 2. I do not do one shot or scenic role play. All of my role play is made for short term or long term role play stories, not one offs to get your dick wet.<br /><br /> 3. If you do not have a profile or a character, do not message me.<br /> <br />4. I novella. This means I write words. A lot of words. If you&rsquo;re good and I like you, I will write more words. I am not interested in your weird one lining.<br /><br /> 5. Never message me with an action. That&rsquo;s creepy and weird. OOC messages or get the fuck out.<br /><br /> 6. I am here for me. Not for you. I don&rsquo;t really care what you think that makes me. </strong></em></p>

<p>There were some people in life that never really struggled. It seemed that Beatrix was one of these people. There was no ultimate struggle in her life that made her the way she was. She didn&rsquo;t lose a parent, get abused as a child, or forced to live on the streets. She certainly had her own share of problems, break ups in high school, struggling in math classes, and discovering what her future wanted to be. Beyond that, she had a nice family life, which dealt with her teenager rebellion and bratty disposition well, a group of solid friends that adored and loved her, and a pretty solid life. She went to college on a scholarship and wandered through her classes until deciding to major in English, not really sure what she was supposed to be doing with her future.<br /><br /> She&rsquo;d never really had to work for anything in her life.<br /><br /> That was until she met him. Down of her knees, choking on the thick cock trying to slam its way down her throat. Mascara ran down her cheeks, lipstick smudged and all but gone, as his hand gripped at her hair and tugged her further down against his dick. <br /><br /> &ldquo;Yes~ Look at my good little broken princess, greedily choking on Daddy&rsquo;s cock.&rdquo; <br /><br /> She&rsquo;d never heard anything like it before, and while she thought she would have hated it, something twisted deep inside of her, flooding her panties as the man used her mouth over and over again. <br /><br /> It was in that moment that she truly became a <span style="color: #582791;"><em>Brat</em></span>.</p>
